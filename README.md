# FlapPy Bird
FlapPy bird plays through an implementation of the classic flappy bird game in python. It uses a neural network to control the game, and finds the solution from scratch through evolution of the network weights.

Try it out:
1. Make sure you are using python 3.x
2. Install pygame library (for graphics): pip install pygame
3. Run: py flappy.py &nbsp; (random initalization)  
or py flappy.py [integer 1 to 4]  
to demo different levels of training from past experiments.

It plays autonomously - but you can optionally press space to control it manually.
